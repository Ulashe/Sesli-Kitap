No effort has been made to change the manner of the spoken, into the more regular form of the written, word. (Summary by M.M. Mangasarian (1859-1943) and Joanne Pauwels)<p>",

      "description": "\"The Foolish Dictionary\" was written by \"Gideon Wurdz\" (the pen name for Charles Wayland Towne) and was published in 1904. According to the beginning of the book, it is \"An exhausting work of reference to un-certain English words, their origin, meaning, legitimate and illegitimate use...\" \n\nThis a a short but amusing dictionary which \"redefines\" words in some interesting ways. Funny and sometimes bizarre observations are sprinkled throughout. In keeping with LibriVox policy to read, rather than attempt to rewrite, books - even those with offensive content - nothing has been omitted. While many of the definitions may just seem confusing or \"corny\" to modern readers, there are a couple that also might be considered \"objectionable,\" particularly in section 10, which contains offensive content of a racial nature. \n\nSummary by Maddie<p>\n",

      "description": "George MacDonald is mainly known for his fantasy works and fairy tales such as At the Back of the North Wind and the Princess and the Goblin. However, during his life he was more famous for many more realistic novels. . . among them the somewhat autobiographical Ranald Bannerman's Boyhood.\n<p>This story of a young motherless boy growing up with his brothers in a Scottish manse is full of delightful characters. There is Kirsty, an enchanting Highland storyteller, Turkey, the intrepid cowherd, the evil Kelpie, and the lovely Elsie Duff. Throughout the twists and turns of his escapades and adventures Ranald learns from his father the important lessons of courage and integrity.</p><p>When Ranald Bannerman's Boyhood came out in 1871 the New York Independent praised it as \"full of sweetness, full of boy-life and true goodness\". Perhaps, but it is also a good story, from the master of storytellers. (Summary by Bookworm)",

      "description": "<p>Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in which she argued that women are not naturally inferior to men, but only appeared to be because they lacked education. She suggested that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagined a social order founded on reason. - Today, Wollstonecraft is considered a foundational thinker in feminist philosophy. Her early advocacy of women's equality and her attacks on conventional femininity and the degradation of women presaged the later emergence of the feminist political movement. Feminist scholars and activists have cited both her philosophical ideas and personal struggles as important influences in their work. <br><br>\n<em>This is one of the 12 Books That Changed the World by Melvyn Bragg.</em> (Summary from Wikipedia and Alex Foster)</p>",

      "description": "Isabella Lucy Bird was a 19th century English traveller, writer, and natural historian. She was a sickly child, however, while she was travelling she was almost always healthy. Her first trip, in 1854, took her to America, visiting relatives. Her first book, <i>The Englishwoman in America</i> was published anonymously two years later.<br><br>\n<i>Unbeaten Tracks in Japan</i> is compiled of the letters she sent to her sister during her 7 months sojourn in Japan in 1878. Her travels there took her from Edo (now called Tokyo) through the interior - where she was often the first foreigner the locals had met - to Niigata, and from there to Aomori. There she crossed over to Yezo (Hokkaido), and her account on the life of the Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, provides an interesting glimpse of days long past. (Summary by Availle)",

The poem is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek hero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after the fall of Troy.</p>\n\nIt takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus' home to compete for Penelope's hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.</p>\n\nThe poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to be read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.
